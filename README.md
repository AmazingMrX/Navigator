# Navigator

 The Navigator Front-End for tumblr is a complete front-end replacement and top down rewrite of tumblr's original desktop blog UI. Built from 2014 to 2018. Static assets were completely replaced with a responsive web design built on modern HTML 5 and CSS 3 standards. All elements of tumblr's standard UI were replaced with brand new code, supporting all known features, and implementing several new and unique navigational tools that had not previously existed on the site.

 A live demo of the Front-End can be viewed in action at: https://askprincesscelestia.com/

 This UI is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
 
 To use this on your own blog, simply edit the site's html through the customization interface and completely replace your own blog's code with the contents of the Navigator.html file. No other assets are required.
